### Fixed

- Fix: use executions table for notes storage instead of workflow_executions (#75)

* fix: use executions table for notes storage instead of workflow_executions

The note handlers (AddExecutionNoteHandler, GetExecutionNotesHandler) were
querying the workflow_executions table, but execution data is actually stored
in the executions table. This caused "execution not found" errors when adding
or retrieving notes via app.note().

Changes:
- Add Notes field to types.Execution struct
- Add notes column to ExecutionRecordModel (GORM auto-migrates this)
- Update SQL queries in execution_records.go to include notes column
- Update scanExecution to deserialize notes JSON
- Change ExecutionNoteStorage interface to use GetExecutionRecord and
  UpdateExecutionRecord instead of GetWorkflowExecution and
  UpdateWorkflowExecution
- Update AddExecutionNoteHandler to use UpdateExecutionRecord
- Update GetExecutionNotesHandler to use GetExecutionRecord

This fixes both the SDK app.note() functionality and the UI notes panel
404 errors.

* fix: update execution notes tests to use correct storage methods

Tests were using WorkflowExecution type and StoreWorkflowExecution() to set up
test data, but the handlers now use Execution type and GetExecutionRecord()/
UpdateExecutionRecord() which query the executionRecords map.

- Change test setup from types.WorkflowExecution to types.Execution
- Change StoreWorkflowExecution() to CreateExecutionRecord()
- Change GetWorkflowExecution() verification to GetExecutionRecord()
- Rename workflowID to runID to match the Execution struct field

## [0.1.22-rc.2] - 2025-12-15


### Added

- Feat(go-sdk): add Memory and Note APIs for agent state and progress tracking (#71)

Add two major new capabilities to the Go SDK:

## Memory System
- Hierarchical scoped storage (workflow, session, user, global)
- Pluggable MemoryBackend interface for custom storage
- Default in-memory backend included
- Automatic scope ID resolution from execution context

## Note API
- Fire-and-forget progress/status messages to AgentField UI
- Note(ctx, message, tags...) and Notef(ctx, format, args...) methods
- Async HTTP delivery with proper execution context headers
- Silent failure mode to avoid interrupting workflows

These additions enable agents to:
- Persist state across handler invocations within a session
- Share data between workflows at different scopes
- Report real-time progress updates visible in the UI

## [0.1.22-rc.1] - 2025-12-15


### Added

- Feat: allow external contributors to run functional tests without API… (#70)

* feat: allow external contributors to run functional tests without API keys

Enable external contributors to run 92% of functional tests (24/26) without
requiring access to OpenRouter API keys. This makes it easier for the community
to contribute while maintaining full test coverage for maintainers.

Changes:
- Detect forked PRs and automatically skip OpenRouter-dependent tests
- Only 2 tests require OpenRouter (LLM integration tests)
- 24 tests validate all core infrastructure without LLM calls
- Update GitHub Actions workflow to conditionally set PYTEST_ARGS
- Update functional test README with clear documentation

Test coverage for external contributors:
✅ Control plane health and APIs
✅ Agent registration and discovery
✅ Multi-agent communication
✅ Memory system (all scopes)
✅ Workflow orchestration
✅ Go/TypeScript SDK integration
✅ Serverless agents
✅ Verifiable credentials

Skipped for external contributors (maintainers still run these):
⏭️  test_hello_world_with_openrouter
⏭️  test_readme_quick_start_summarize_flow

This change addresses the challenge of running CI for external contributors
without exposing repository secrets while maintaining comprehensive test
coverage for the core AgentField platform functionality.

* fix: handle push events correctly in functional tests workflow

The workflow was failing on push events (to main/testing branches) because
it relied on github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork which is null for
push events. This caused the workflow to incorrectly fall into the else
branch and fail when OPENROUTER_API_KEY wasn't set.

Changes:
- Check github.event_name to differentiate between push, pull_request, and workflow_dispatch
- Explicitly handle push and workflow_dispatch events to run all tests with API key
- Preserve fork PR detection to skip OpenRouter tests for external contributors

Now properly handles:
✅ Fork PRs: Skip 2 OpenRouter tests, run 24/26 tests
✅ Internal PRs: Run all 26 tests with API key
✅ Push to main/testing: Run all 26 tests with API key
✅ Manual workflow dispatch: Run all 26 tests with API key

* fix: remove shell quoting from PYTEST_ARGS to prevent argument parsing errors

The PYTEST_ARGS variable contained single quotes around '-m "not openrouter" -v'
which would be included in the environment variable value. When passed to pytest
in the Docker container shell command, this caused the entire string to be treated
as a single argument instead of being properly split into separate arguments.

Changed from: '-m "not openrouter" -v'
Changed to:   -m not openrouter -v

This allows the shell's word splitting to correctly parse the arguments when
pytest $$PYTEST_ARGS is evaluated in the docker-compose command.

* refactor: separate pytest marker expression from general args for proper quoting

The previous approach of embedding -m not openrouter inside PYTEST_ARGS was
fragile because shell word-splitting doesn't guarantee "not openrouter" stays
together as a single argument to the -m flag.

This change introduces PYTEST_MARK_EXPR as a dedicated variable for the marker
expression, which is then properly quoted when passed to pytest:
  pytest -m "$PYTEST_MARK_EXPR" $PYTEST_ARGS ...

Benefits:
- Marker expression is guaranteed to be treated as single argument to -m
- Clear separation between marker selection and general pytest args
- More maintainable for future marker additions
- Eliminates shell quoting ambiguity

Changes:
- workflow: Split PYTEST_ARGS into PYTEST_MARK_EXPR + PYTEST_ARGS
- docker-compose: Add PYTEST_MARK_EXPR env var and conditional -m flag
- docker-compose: Only apply -m when PYTEST_MARK_EXPR is non-empty

* fix: add proper event type checks before accessing pull_request context

Prevent errors when workflow runs on push events by:
- Check event_name == 'pull_request' before accessing pull_request.head.repo.fork
- Check event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' before accessing event.inputs
- Ensures all conditional expressions only access context properties when they exist

This prevents "Error: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'fork')" errors
on push events.

### Fixed

- Fix(python-sdk): move conditional imports to module level (#72)

The `serve()` method had `import os` and `import urllib.parse` statements
inside conditional blocks. When an explicit port was passed, the first
conditional block was skipped, but Python's scoping still saw the later
conditional imports, causing an `UnboundLocalError` when trying to use
`os.getenv()` at line 1140.

Error seen in Docker containers:
```
UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'os' where it is not
associated with a value
```

This worked locally because `auto_port=True` executed the first code path
which included `import os`, but failed in Docker when passing an explicit
port value.

Fix: Move all imports to module level where they belong.

## [0.1.21-rc.2] - 2025-12-10


### Fixed

- Fix: correct parent execution ID for sub-calls in app.call() (#62)

When a reasoner calls a skill via app.call(), the X-Parent-Execution-ID
  header was incorrectly set to the inherited parent instead of the current
  execution. This caused workflow graphs to show incorrect parent-child
  relationships.

  The fix overrides X-Parent-Execution-ID to use the current execution's ID
  after to_headers() is called, ensuring sub-calls are correctly attributed
  as children of the calling execution.

* fix(sdk/typescript): add DID registration to enable VC generation

The TypeScript SDK was not registering with the DID system, causing VC
generation to fail with "failed to resolve caller DID: DID not found".

This change adds DID registration to match the Python SDK's behavior:

- Add DIDIdentity types and registerAgent() to DidClient
- Create DidManager class to store identity package after registration
- Integrate DidManager into Agent.ts to auto-register on startup
- Update getDidInterface() to resolve DIDs from stored identity package

When didEnabled is true, the agent now:
1. Registers with /api/v1/nodes/register (existing)
2. Registers with /api/v1/did/register (new)
3. Stores identity package for DID resolution
4. Auto-populates callerDid/targetDid when generating VCs

### Added

- Feat(release): unify PyPI publishing for all releases (#58)

Publish all Python SDK releases (both prerelease and stable) to PyPI
instead of using TestPyPI for prereleases.

Per PEP 440, prerelease versions (e.g., 0.1.20rc1) are excluded by
default from `pip install` - users must explicitly use `--pre` flag.
This simplifies the release process and removes the need for the
TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN secret.

Changes:
- Merge TestPyPI and PyPI publish steps into single PyPI step
- Update release notes to show `pip install --pre` for staging
- Update install.sh staging output
- Re-enable example requirements updates for prereleases
- Update RELEASE.md documentation

### Fixed

- Fix(release): fix example requirements and prevent future staging bumps (#56)

* fix(examples): revert to stable agentfield version (0.1.19)

The staging release bumped example requirements to 0.1.20-rc.1, but
RC versions are published to TestPyPI, not PyPI. This caused Railway
deployments to fail because pip couldn't find the package.

Revert to the last stable version (0.1.19) which is available on PyPI.

* fix(release): skip example requirements bump for prerelease versions

Prerelease versions are published to TestPyPI, not PyPI. If we bump
example requirements.txt files to require a prerelease version,
Railway deployments will fail because pip looks at PyPI by default.

Now bump_version.py only updates example requirements for stable
releases, ensuring deployed examples always use versions available
on PyPI. (c86bec5)

- Production: Manual workflow dispatch (PyPI, npm @latest, vX.Y.Z + latest Docker)

Changes:
- Add push trigger with path filters for automatic staging
- Replace release_channel with release_environment input
- Unified PyPI publishing for both staging (prerelease) and production
- Split npm publishing: @next tag (staging) vs @latest (production)

This fix injects the API key into request headers automatically when:
- The client has an api_key configured
- The header isn't already set (avoids overwriting explicit headers)

### Fixed

- Fix(control-plane): remove redundant WebSocket origin check

The WebSocket upgrader's CheckOrigin was rejecting server-to-server
connections (like from Python SDK agents) that don't have an Origin
header. This caused 403 errors when agents tried to connect to memory
events WebSocket endpoint with auth enabled.

The origin check was redundant because:
1. Auth middleware already validates API keys before this handler
2. If auth is enabled, only valid API key holders reach this point
3. If auth is disabled, all connections are allowed anyway

Removes the origin checking logic and simplifies NewMemoryEventsHandler
to just take the storage provider.

- Update install.sh to create venv before waiting for PyPI

The issue was that buildCommand runs after the default install phase,

- Feat(sdk-python): expose execution context via app.ctx property

Add a `ctx` property to the Agent class that provides direct access to
the current execution context during reasoner/skill execution. This
enables a more ergonomic API:

Before:
  from agentfield.execution_context import get_current_context
  ctx = get_current_context()
  workflow_id = ctx.workflow_id

After:
  workflow_id = app.ctx.workflow_id

The property returns None when accessed outside of an active execution
(e.g., at module level or after a request completes), matching the
behavior of app.memory. This prevents accidental use of stale or
placeholder context data.

Also fixes integration test fixtures to support the current monorepo
structure where control-plane lives at repo root instead of
apps/platform/agentfield.

- execution_queue: worker_count, request_timeout, lease_duration,
  max_attempts, failure_backoff, max_failure_backoff, poll_interval,

Removed from Go structs:
- AgentsConfig, DiscoveryConfig, ScalingConfig
- CoreFeatures, EnterpriseFeatures
- DataDirectoriesConfig
- Unused fields from AgentFieldConfig, ExecutionQueueConfig,
  LocalStorageConfig, StorageConfig, UIConfig

The remaining config options are all actively used:
- agentfield.port, execution_cleanup.*, execution_queue webhook settings
- ui.enabled/mode/dev_port
- api.cors.*
- storage.mode/local.database_path/local.kv_store_path/vector.*

- Restructuring and clarifying the prompt instructions for citations, providing explicit guidance on how to use and format them.
- Enhancing the citation key map format to be more descriptive and user-friendly for the LLM.
- Explicitly stating that the `citations` array in the response should be left empty by the LLM, as it will be injected by the system.
- Updating the `Citation` schema to correctly reflect that the `key` should not include brackets.

- Minor cleanup and adjustments to prompt text for better readability. (56246ad)

- Update dependencies for improved compatibility

Updates several npm package dependencies, including browserslist, caniuse-lite, and electron-to-chromium, to their latest versions.
This ensures better compatibility and incorporates recent improvements and bug fixes from these packages. (c72278c)

- Implement automatic agent method delegation

Improves the AgentRouter by implementing __getattr__ to automatically delegate any unknown attribute or method access to the attached agent. This eliminates the need for explicit delegation methods for agent functionalities like `ai()`, `call()`, `memory`, `note()`, and `discover()`.

This change simplifies the AgentRouter's interface and makes it more transparently proxy agent methods. Added tests to verify the automatic delegation for various agent methods and property access, as well as error handling when no agent is attached. (26c9288)

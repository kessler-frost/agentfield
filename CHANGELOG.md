## [0.1.9] - 2025-11-25


### Other

- Un-hardcode agent request timeout (4b9789f)

- Remove --import-mode=importlib from pytest config

This flag was causing issues with functional tests in postgres mode.
The Python 3.8 PyO3 issue is already fixed by disabling coverage
for Python 3.8 in the CI workflow.

- Add Python 3.8 compatibility for asyncio.to_thread

asyncio.to_thread was added in Python 3.9. This commit adds a
compatibility shim using loop.run_in_executor for Python 3.8.

Fixes test failures:
- test_execute_async_falls_back_to_requests
- test_set_posts_payload
- test_async_request_falls_back_to_requests
- test_memory_round_trip

- Fix Python 3.8 CI: Disable coverage for Python 3.8

The PyO3 modules in pydantic-core can only be initialized once per
interpreter on Python 3.8. pytest-cov causes module reimports during
coverage collection, triggering this limitation.

Solution:
- Keep --import-mode=importlib for better import handling
- Disable coverage collection (--no-cov) only for Python 3.8 in CI
- Coverage still collected for Python 3.9-3.12

This is a known compatibility issue with PyO3 + Python 3.8 + pytest-cov.

- Fix Python 3.8 CI: Add --import-mode=importlib to pytest config

Resolves PyO3 ImportError on Python 3.8 by configuring pytest to use
importlib import mode. This prevents PyO3 modules (pydantic-core) from
being initialized multiple times, which causes failures on Python 3.8.

- Fix linting error: Remove unused Dict import from pydantic_utils

The Dict type from typing was imported but never used in the file.
This was causing the CI to fail with ruff lint error F401.

- Add Python 3.8+ support to Python SDK

Lower the minimum Python version requirement from 3.10 to 3.8 to improve
compatibility with systems running older Python versions.

Changes:
- Update pyproject.toml to require Python >=3.8
- Add Python 3.8, 3.9 to package classifiers
- Fix type hints incompatible with Python 3.8:
  - Replace list[T] with List[T]
  - Replace dict[K,V] with Dict[K,V]
  - Replace tuple[T,...] with Tuple[T,...]
  - Replace set[T] with Set[T]
  - Replace str | None with Optional[str]
- Update CI to test on Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- Update documentation to reflect Python 3.8+ requirement

All dependencies (FastAPI, Pydantic v2, litellm, etc.) support Python 3.8+.
Tested and verified on Python 3.8.18.

- Update doc url (dc6f361)

- Fix README example: Use AIConfig for model configuration

- Changed from incorrect Agent(node_id='researcher', model='gpt-4o')
- To correct Agent(node_id='researcher', ai_config=AIConfig(model='gpt-4o'))
- Added AIConfig import to the example
- Model configuration should be passed through ai_config parameter, not directly to Agent (34bf018)

- Removes MCP documentation section

Removes the documentation section detailing the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
This section is no longer relevant to the current project structure. (3361f8c)

## [0.1.8] - 2025-11-23


### Other

- Automate changelog generation with git-cliff

Integrates git-cliff into the release workflow to automatically generate changelog entries from commit history. This streamlines the release process by eliminating manual changelog updates.

The CONTRIBUTING.md file has been updated to reflect this new process and guide contributors on how to structure their commits for effective changelog generation. A new script, `scripts/update_changelog.py`, is called to perform the changelog update during the release process. (d3e1146)

- Refactors agent AI token counting and trimming

Replaces lambda functions for `token_counter` and `trim_messages` with explicit function definitions in `AgentAI` to improve clarity and maintainability.

Additionally, this commit removes an unused import in `test_discovery_api.py` and cleans up some print statements and a redundant context manager wrapper in `test_go_sdk_cli.py` and `test_hello_world.py` respectively. (7880ff3)

- Remove unused Generator import

Removes the `Generator` type hint from the imports in `conftest.py`, as it is no longer being used. This is a minor cleanup to reduce unnecessary imports. (7270ce8)

- Final commit (1aa676e)

- Add discovery API endpoint

Introduces a new endpoint to the control plane for discovering agent capabilities.
This includes improvements to the Python SDK to support querying and parsing discovery results.

- Adds `InvalidateDiscoveryCache()` calls in node registration handlers to ensure cache freshness.
- Implements discovery routes in the control plane server.
- Enhances the Python SDK with `discover` method, including new types for discovery responses and improved `Agent` and `AgentFieldClient` classes.
- Refactors `AsyncExecutionManager` and `ResultCache` for lazy initialization of asyncio objects and `shutdown_event`.
- Adds new types for discovery API responses in `sdk/python/agentfield/types.py`.
- Introduces unit tests for the new `discover_capabilities` functionality in the client. (ab2417b)

- Updated (6f1f58d)

- Initial prd (4ed1ea5)

- Adds decorator-based API for global memory event listeners

Introduces a decorator to simplify subscribing to global memory change events,
enabling more readable and maintainable event-driven code.

Enhances test coverage by verifying event listener patterns via functional tests,
ensuring decorators correctly capture events under various scenarios. (608b8c6)

- Update functional tests and docker configuration

- Remove PRD_GO_SDK_CLI.md document
- Update docker compose configurations for local and postgres setups
- Modify test files for Go SDK CLI and memory events (4fa2bb7)

- Adds CLI support and configuration to agent module

Introduces options for registering CLI-accessible handlers, custom CLI formatting, and descriptions.
Adds a configuration struct for CLI behavior and presentation.
Refactors agent initialization to allow operation without a server URL in CLI mode.
Improves error handling and test coverage for new CLI logic. (54f483b)
